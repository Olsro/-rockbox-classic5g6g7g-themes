# retroTapeFixed
Modified/Derived from retroTape theme for iPod Video (CC-BY-SA 3.0) by Humberto Santana.

Changelog : 
- Use the font "Rockbox-Mix" in menus and in WPS. This design choice results in full compatibility with Chinese/Japanese/Korean characters.
- Removed the visual lines in the background of the menus. This was causing visual issues depending on the size of the selected font.
- Cover art is now hidden in the quick screen menu. Showing album art in the menu was causing visual glitches when using shortcuts in this menu.
- Show icons in menus by default
